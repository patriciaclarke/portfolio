Hence, as a teacher, I live to help every child who walks in my circle to develop his/her potential to be all he/she can be. In order to do this, I endeavor to assist students to discover who they are, so that they can express their own opinions and nurture their own ideas. I also endeavor to bring Christ-like teaching to my classes so that students will know and understand that ultimate knowledge comes only from God. Further, having realized that the world has been, and will continue to operate as one global village, I have a vision for Jamaica; one in which we are able to communicate with people beyond all boundaries with utmost respect and understanding of the differences between each other. Hence, developing world class verbal and written communicators is my life’s mission. </span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><i><strong>In addition, </strong></i></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">I understand that every classroom presents a unique community of learners that varies not only in abilities but also in learning styles. Therefore, my role as a teacher is to give students the tools with which to cultivate their own gardens of knowledge. To accomplish this goal, I teach to the needs of each child by practicing equity over equality. I also work assiduously to make learning as relevant as possible to each child’s life. Additionally, I also incorporate themes, projects, group work, individual work, and hands-on learning in order to make students active learners. My classroom is also a collaborative learning space. This is done in keeping with Jamaica’s </span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>National Standard Curriculum (NSC),</strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> and the </span></span><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"> </span></span></span><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>(</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>CSEC</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">) expectations</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">.</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> I also engender an atmosphere where children see and foster the need to be helpful, caring, and active members of society. </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><i><strong>Thirdly</strong></i></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">, I believe wholeheartedly that one’s environment is paramount to one’s ability to perform; hence, my classroom is a caring, safe, and equitable environment where each child can blossom and grow. I allow children to become responsible by giving them control over aspects of their learning experience such as class meetings, devotions, collection of books, and the upkeep of the classroom’s environs. I also allow them to be a part of disciplinary and even teaching strategies and hold them accountable thereafter for any infringement made on agreed upon principles and expected behaviors. It is my hope that by doing this, I am helping them to become successful men and women of society; men and women who believe in themselves, love themselves, and respect themselves. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><i><strong>Lastly, </strong></i></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">teaching is lifelong learning. It is about learning new philosophies and new strategies; it is about learning from parents and community; learning from colleagues; and especially learning from children. Overtime, students have taught me the importance of having an open mind; they have taught me to accept the joys, the innocence, the moments of trials, and the diversity of ideas this world has to offer. As a result of this, I never forget to accept the challenges, and celebrate the successes of all the children I get the privilege to help mold in becoming the future that I want to enjoy in my goldens years. Above all, I do not miss an opportunity to remind every child to put and keep Christ at the center of all he/she does. </span></span></p>",
